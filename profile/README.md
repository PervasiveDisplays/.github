**Pervasive Displays Inc.** designs, manufactures and markets e-paper displays (EPD) for applications requiring high resolution, good readability and low power consumption. Pervasive Displays focuses on commercial and industrial applications and is the world leading vendor with most experience in E Ink e-paper technology. 

## EPD hardware drivers

The following drivers provide a quick example with built-in images for test.

* [Pervasive_Wide_Small](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/Pervasive_Wide_Small) for Wide-Temperature small-sized 1.52", 1.54", 2.06", 2.13", 2.66", 2.71", 2.9", 3.70", 4.2" and 4.37" screens
* [Pervasive_Wide_Medium](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/Pervasive_Wide_Medium) for Wide-Temperature medium-sized 5.81" and 7.4" screens
* [Pervasive_BWRY_Small](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/Pervasive_BWRY_Small) for small-sized 1.54", 2.13", 2.66", 4.2" Spectra 4/BWRY type screens

## Pervasive Displays Library Suite 

The **Pervasive Displays Library Suite** is specifically designed for the [Pervasive Displays](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com) screens and boards. It provides the text and graphic primitives for all the screens and supports capacitive touch on touch-screens.

* [PDLS_Common](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_Common) provides a light hardware abstraction layer with C-like syntax for C and C++ SDKs. It is required by the drivers and the PDLS library.
* [PDLS_Basic](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_Basic) for Pervasive Displays with wide temperature and embedded fast update (film `K`) and four color (film `Q`) with EXT3.1 extension kit
* [PDLS_EXT3_Basic_Touch](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_EXT3_Basic_Touch) for Pervasive Displays iTC monochrome touch-screens with EXT3-Touch extension kit
* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-orange) [PDLS_EXT4_Basic_Matter](https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_EXT4_Basic_Matter) for Pervasive Displays E-Paper Development Kit for Matter (EPDK-Matter) and monochrome screens with wide temperature and embedded fast update (film `K`)
